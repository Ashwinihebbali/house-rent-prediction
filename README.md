# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages traditional machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices using datasets like the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
Users can estimate property prices based on features such as *crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, and pupil-teacher ratio*.  
Built with *Python* and *Streamlit*, it offers an **interactive and user-friendly interface** for both single and batch predictions.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📊 Accurate house price predictions using *regression models*  
- 🖥 Interactive *Streamlit web application* 
- 📝 Supports *single and batch inputs via CSV* 
- 🧹 Handles numerical and categorical features efficiently

---

## ⚙ Prerequisites
- *Python 3.8+*  
- *pip*  

Required Python packages:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit joblib
```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwinihebbali/house-rent-prediction.git
cd house-rent-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Launch the Application  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

A local URL will be displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8501`).  
Open it in your browser to interact with the application by entering property details or uploading a CSV file to predict housing prices.

### ✅ Deployment
The project has already been pushed to GitHub and deployed on [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/). You can access the live app [here](https://ashwinihebbali-house-rent-prediction-app-train-test-yghgvh.streamlit.app/).

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and normalizes numerical features  
- **Model:** Regression algorithms like *Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests*, etc.  
- **Training:** Models are trained on historical housing data with evaluation metrics such as *RMSE* and *MAE*  
- **Deployment:** The trained model is saved as `boston_best_model.pkl` and loaded into the Streamlit app for predictions
